    title: 'Section 1: Introduction',
    content: `
      This section defines the Environment as the combination of all living (biotic) and non-living (abiotic) things. It covers the three main components: the Natural Environment (plants, animals, water, air), the Human-Made Environment (buildings, roads), and the Social Environment (family, culture, laws). It also introduces the four spheres of Earth: Lithosphere (land), Hydrosphere (water), Atmosphere (air), and Biosphere (life), emphasizing that they are all interconnected.

    title: 'Section 2: Sustainability',
    content: `
      This section explains Sustainability as meeting our needs without harming the ability of future generations to meet theirs. It is based on three pillars: Environmental (conserving resources), Social (ensuring fairness and access to education/healthcare), and Economic (creating planet-friendly jobs). Examples of sustainable practices include using solar panels, rainwater harvesting, and avoiding single-use plastics.

    title: 'Section 3: Human Impact',
    content: `
      This section details how human activities cause environmental degradation. Key topics include: Air Pollution from vehicle and factory smoke; Water Pollution from industrial waste and sewage; Soil Degradation from overuse of chemical fertilizers and mining; Deforestation which is cutting forests for agriculture or infrastructure, leading to biodiversity loss and global warming; and Waste Overload from excessive plastic use and lack of recycling, which creates toxic landfills and harms marine life.

    title: 'Section 4: Climate Change',
    content: `
      This section focuses on Climate Change, defined as the long-term shift in global weather patterns caused by human activities. The main causes are Greenhouse Gas Emissions (from burning fossil fuels like coal and oil) and Deforestation. The visible effects include rising sea levels from melting glaciers, more extreme weather like floods and heatwaves, and threats to food security. Global efforts like the Paris Agreement aim to combat this.

    title: 'Section 5: Key Terms',
    content: `
      This section provides essential environmental definitions. An Ecosystem is a community of living and non-living things interacting. A Carbon Footprint is the total greenhouse gas released by an activity. The Greenhouse Effect is the natural process of gases trapping heat. Global Warming is the gradual increase in Earth's temperature. Biodegradable items (like paper) break down naturally, while Non-Biodegradable items (like plastic) do not. Renewable Resources (like sun and wind) replenish naturally, while Non-Renewable Resources (like coal and oil) will run out.
