    title: 'Module 1: The Earth as a System',
    content: `
      This section introduces Systems Thinking, viewing Earth as a dynamic, interconnected system of four subsystems that exchange energy and matter: the Atmosphere (gases), Hydrosphere (water), Geosphere (solid Earth), and Biosphere (life). It covers the Anthropocene epoch, where human activity is the dominant force of change, and introduces feedback loops like Ice-Albedo (positive) and Carbon Absorption (negative). It also discusses ocean acidification as a consequence of system imbalance.

    title: 'Module 2: Unsustainable Growth',
    content: `
      This section explores the dilemma between development and environmental cost. It defines the Human Development Index (HDI) as a measure of progress (health, education, income) and the Ecological Footprint as the measure of resource consumption. It highlights the concept of Climate Injustice, where the Global North is historically responsible for most emissions, while the Global South is most vulnerable to the impacts. It also defines externalities as the hidden costs of economic activity paid by society, not the polluter.

    title: 'Module 3: Global Action',
    content: `
      This section covers major international environmental agreements. Key milestones include the 1972 Stockholm Conference, the 1987 Montreal Protocol (which successfully healed the ozone layer), the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio (which introduced sustainable development), the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, and the crucial 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to 1.5°C. It also explains the role of annual COP (Conference of the Parties) meetings.

    title: 'Module 4: Cities and Tech',
    content: `
      This section contrasts unplanned Urban Sprawl with the promise of Smart Cities, which use technology for digital governance, sustainable design, and smart mobility. It highlights key sustainable infrastructure like green architecture and public transport. It also warns against hidden traps like Greenwashing (faking eco-friendliness) and Techno-Solutionism (over-reliance on tech while ignoring policy), emphasizing that true development must be inclusive and just.

    title: 'Module 5: Water Management',
    content: `
      This section focuses on Wastewater Management. Wastewater comes from homes, industries, and farms. It must be treated in Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) to protect public health and the environment. The process involves Primary (removing solids), Secondary (biological cleaning), and Tertiary (advanced purification) treatments. Treated water is a valuable resource that can be reused for non-drinking purposes like irrigation and industrial cooling, reducing pressure on freshwater sources.
