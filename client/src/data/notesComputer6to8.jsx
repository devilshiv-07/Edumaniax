    title: "Section 1: What is AI",
    content:
      "Explains AI as giving machines a 'digital brain' so they can think and act like humans. Shows everyday uses in phones (face recognition, Siri, autocorrect), entertainment (YouTube, Netflix, Spotify), games (smart enemies, adaptive difficulty), shopping (recommendations), and transportation (self-driving cars, Google Maps). Provides a detailed example of robot vacuums that learn layouts, recognize dirt, and return to charging stations. Introduces pattern recognition and smart devices through a recap table.",

    title: "Section 2: How AI Work?",
    content:
      "Covers how AI learns like a student by practicing with data. Breaks down steps: Input (getting information), Processing (finding patterns), and Output (giving answers). Example: AI recognizing dogs from millions of photos. Introduces types of AI: Rule-based (fixed instructions), Learning AI (gets better with data), and Smart AI (like humans, still developing). Includes comparison table of strengths and limits.",

    title: "Section 3: Types of AI",
    content:
      "Introduces Narrow AI (specialist in one task, like Google Translate or Chess AI), General AI (future, multi-talented like humans), and Machine Learning (learning from examples, like spam detection or Spotify recommendations). Highlights fun uses in games, digital pets, and smart cars. Provides summary table comparing each AI type, examples, and how people use it.",

    topicId: "4",
    title: "Section 4: AI Can and Can't Do",
    content:
      "Shows what AI can do: communicate (Siri, Google Translate, Grammarly), entertain (Netflix, AI music), help in healthcare (spot diseases, detect falls), and assist in daily life (navigation, shopping, photography). Explains limits: AI can’t feel emotions, imagine truly new ideas, understand ethics, or handle every real-world surprise. Uses examples like self-driving cars struggling with unusual situations. Provides task table comparing AI abilities and limits.",

    topicId: "5",
    title: "Section 5: AI Words",
    content:
      "Defines key vocabulary: Data, Algorithm, Training, Chatbot, Robot, Neural Network, Big Data, Cloud Computing. Shows each with simple meaning, detailed explanation, and real example. Explains vocabulary in real scenarios like taking a photo (data + algorithms), asking Siri (chatbot + cloud computing), and watching YouTube (big data + recommendations).",

    topicId: "6",
    title: "Section 6: Build an AI",
    content:
      "Encourages students to think like AI engineers. Steps: Identify a problem, design an AI blueprint (bot name, users, features, data), draw appearance/interface, and test usefulness. Example: HomeworkBuddy, an AI that reminds students of assignments, breaks tasks into smaller steps, and provides study tips. Ends with earning a badge: AI Innovation Designer.",

    topicId: "7",
    title: "Section 7: Test Your AI Skills & Importance of AI",
    content:
      "Combines AI skill-testing with ethical use. Provides quiz questions on AI basics, real-world applications, capabilities, machine learning, ethics, and future impact. Includes tasks like spotting AI on devices, comparing AI systems, and designing school/community solutions. Defines mastery levels from Bronze to Diamond, and suggests an AI Showcase activity. Also emphasizes using AI judiciously: AI should be a helper, not a replacement. Good example: Grammarly checking grammar; bad example: AI writing full essays. Highlights balance between learning skills and using AI wisely.",
