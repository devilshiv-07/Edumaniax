    title: 'Unit 1: Biogeochemical Cycles',
    content: `
      This unit covers the Earth's natural recycling systems. Key cycles include: The Carbon Cycle (movement of carbon through photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition), The Nitrogen Cycle (conversion of atmospheric nitrogen by bacteria), The Water Cycle (evaporation, condensation, precipitation), and The Phosphorus Cycle (slow movement of phosphorus from rocks to soil and life). Human activities like burning fossil fuels and using fertilizers disrupt these essential cycles.
